# Hand 'N Paw

Hand â€˜N Paw was designed to help facilitate the adoption and rescue of dogs in need, in addition to connecting people with the right dog for their family and lifestyle. The desired result is to reduce the overcrowding of shelters and the creation of more need.

Created as the second group project for the First Cohort of George Washington University Coding Bootcamp.
